## 🛠️ Supported Versions

We currently **only support version 1.4.0**, as it is the only working version. A recent DNS update by KSF has rendered newer versions incompatible with the Securly ONC on Chromebooks. Therefore, we must use **version 1.4.0**.

| **Version** | **Supported**      |
|-------------|--------------------|
| **1.4.0**   | ✅ Yes             |
| **>3.0.0**  | ❌ No              |
| **1.0.0**   | ❌ No              |
