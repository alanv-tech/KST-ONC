INSTRUCTIONS
Go to the main page at https://github.com/killsecurly/ONC
If it is blocked, use the PDF bypass to get there.

Click on it, and then click on “Releases” at the top right corner.



Next, scroll down and look for “v1.4.0 Stable”. Then click on the highlighted areas.



Then, open the file manager by clicking on the circle button at the bottom right corner of your screen. Type in “Files” and hit enter.


To make sure it has downloaded, go to your downloads folder and look for “ONC-1.4.0.zip”.



In a new tab in Chrome, enter “chrome://network” in the URL bar and click on “Network State”.



 Now click on the plus sign to the left of the network you want to disable Securly on.


 Copy all the text that appears. It should start with “{“ and end with “}”	


Go back to the file manager. Click on “ONC-1.4.0.zip” and look for the file “index.html”.
It should bring up a webpage that looks like this:



 Now paste your network properties into the “Type Network Properties” box and click on “Download ONC”
Then, go back to the file manager and open the network.zip file.



Open it and drag the “kill.onc” file (your killswitch) into the downloads folder.



Go back to the “chrome://network” tab and go to “General”.



11. Scroll all the way down until you see “Import ONC File” and click on “Choose File”
After that, import your “kill.onc”


12. Close and reopen Chrome (NOT YOUR CHROMEBOOK)
