Temporary guide: Click the green "Code" button. Click download zip. Extract the zip file and open the "index.html" file. This should open up a page in your browser. Open a new tab and type "chrome://network" imto the URL bar. Go to "network state" and click the plus button to the left of the network you want to disable Securly on. Copy the network details and paste them back in the index.html tab. Click "download" and open the newly downloaded file. Drag "kill.onc" to your downloads folder. Go back to the chrome://network tab and click general. Scroll all the way down and click "Choose File". Import your kill.onc. You did it
